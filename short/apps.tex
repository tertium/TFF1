\section{Applications}
\label{sec_apps}

A number of applications already support TFF1. Geoff
Sutcliffe has extended the TPTP World infrastructure to process TFF1 problems
and solutions. This involved adapting the Backus--Naur form specification of the
TPTP syntaxes, from which parsers are generated.%
\footnote{\url{http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html}}
Some TPTP tools still need to be ported to TFF1; this is ongoing work.

%%% TODO: update: grep "pure"
The Why3 \cite{bobot-et-al-2011} environment, which defines its own ML-like
polymorphic specification language, can parse pure TFF1. Why3 translates
between TFF1 and a wide range of
formats, including FOF, SMT-LIB, and
Alt-Ergo's native syntax \cite{couchot-lescuyer-2007,bobot-paskevich-2011}.
This support is exploited by the new  tool for HOL Light.
In addition, Why3's TFF1 parser is being ported to
Alt-Ergo \cite{bobot-et-al-2008}, so that it can directly process TFF1. % problems.

%Code sharing is facilitated here by the use of
%a common implementation language (OCaml).

HOL(y)Hammer \cite{kaliszyk-urban-2013}
and Sledgehammer \cite{paulson-blanchette-2010}
integrate various automatic provers
in the proof assistants HOL~Light and Isabelle\slash HOL. They have been
extended to output pure TFF1 problems for Alt-Ergo and Why3
(in addition to FOF, TFF0, and THF0).
%For the first time, Sledgehammer
%exploits the polymorphic potential of these tools---without having
%to implement their native file formats.
%Moreover,
Using Sledgehammer, we produced 987~problems to populate the TPTP library.%

%By extending the tool with a TFF1 parser,
%we hope to transform it into a versatile translator to FOF and
%TFF0 \cite{blanchette-et-al-2013-types}.

%Other tools, notably an LF-based type checker similar to TwHelFTC for THF0, are
%in development.
