TODO:

  * In particular, from the application perspective I find it a bit unfortunate
    that type instantiations must be explicitly given. Type inference for the
    rank-1 fragment is so well-understood it seems hardly a burden on the
    implementer to conform with more standard presentation of syntax.

  * It seems one might as well go to arbitrary rank polymorphism, if the syntax
    is as explicit as proposed here.

  * have the examples in "ordinary" (mathematical) syntax in Sect. 2 (something
    along the lines of ML or Haskell), and the specific TFF1 syntax.

  * p2 Since the type parameters are explicitly bound, why is the capitalization
    rules needed?

  * p3. Are "tff" and "type" keywords? If so, please make the type setting
    suggest so (and/or say so in the text).

  * p6 "polymorphism ... likely that other reasoning tools will gradually follow
    suit" This is entirely possible and may indeed be a good thing. However, a
    similar (and easier to argue) point could be made that quantifiers are
    required by many applications and therefore it is likely that most SMT
    solvers will take the effort to incorporate good support for
    quantifiers--but this hope has not yet played out in practice, where Z3
    seems substantially better than other SMT solvers at handling quantifiers
    and several SMT solvers (like OpenSMT) don't support quantifiers at all. My
    message is: Regarding polymorphism, there continues to be some resistance,
    but one should keep pushing the idea (if one believes in it).

  * add: unsurpringly, preliminary experiments show that it's better to use
    Alt-Ergo's polymorphism directly than to use any of the complete encodings
    of polymorphisms provided by Why3 and Sledgehammer


MAYBE:


DONE:

  * p2 "parentheses in form (c) are omitted if n=1".

  * p2, say what makes $o a "pseudotype"

  * What is the role of the identifiers that end with "_t"?


IGNORED:

  * p2, "If sigma is of form (c), it must be enclosed in parentheses". This just
    seems awkward to me. That is, this rule and the wording used to describe it
    seems to miss out on the well-known wonders of parsing. Instead of saying
    (and defining) it this way, why not just say what the binding powers of *,
    >, etc. are and say that the parens can be used around any type?

  * It would have been interesting to have a detailed report on the experiments
    with TFF1, to assess the impact of TFF1 in practice.
