\begin{abstract}
The TPTP World is a well-established infrastructure for automatic theorem
provers. It defines several concrete syntaxes,
notably an untyped first-order form (FOF) and a typed first-order form (TFF0),
that have become de facto standards.
% in the automated reasoning community.
This paper introduces the TFF1 format, an extension of TFF0 with
rank-1 polymorphism. It presents its syntax, typing rules, and semantics, as
well as a sound and complete translation to TFF0. The format is designed to be
easy to process by existing reasoning tools that support ML-style polymorphism.
It opens the door to useful middleware, such as monomorphizers and other
translation tools that encode polymorphism in FOF or TFF0. Ultimately, the hope
is that TFF1 will be implemented in popular automatic theorem provers.
