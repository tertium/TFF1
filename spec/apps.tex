\section{Applications}
\label{sec_apps}

A number of applications already support TFF1. Geoff
Sutcliffe has extended the TPTP World infrastructure to process TFF1 problems
and solutions. This involved in particular adapting the BNF specification of the
TPTP syntaxes, from which parsers are generated. Some TPTP tools still need to be
ported to TFF1; this is ongoing work.

%%% TODO: update: grep "pure"
The Why3 \cite{bobot-et-al-2011} environment, which defines its own ML-like
polymorphic specification language, can parse pure TFF1. Why3 translates
between TFF1 and a wide range of
formats, including FOF, SMT-LIB, and
Alt-Ergo's native syntax. In addition, Why3's TFF1 parser is being ported to
Alt-Ergo \cite{bobot-et-al-2008}, so that it can directly process TFF1. % problems.

%Code sharing is facilitated here by the use of

Sledgehammer \cite{paulson-blanchette-2010}, a tool that bridges the interactive
theorem prover Isabelle\slash HOL and various automatic provers, has now been
extended to output pure TFF1 problems for Alt-Ergo and Why3
(in addition to FOF, TFF0, and THF0). For the first time, Sledgehammer
exploits the polymorphic potential of these tools---without having
to implement their (incompatible) native file formats.
Moreover, using Sledgehammer, we produced 987 problems to populate the TPTP
library.%

By extending the tool with a TFF1 parser,
we hope to transform the tool into a versatile translator to FOF and
TFF0.
