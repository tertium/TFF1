\section{Applications}
\label{sec_apps}

Geoff Sutcliffe has extended the TPTP World infrastructure to process TFF1
problems and solutions. This involved in particular adapting the BNF
specification of the TPTP syntaxes, from which parsers are generated. Some tools
still need to be ported to TFF1; this is ongoing work.
%
A few other applications already provide some support for TFF1:
%
\begin{itemize}
%\item The SMT solver Alt-Ergo \cite{bobot-et-al-2008} can process problems
%expressed in TFF1 in addition to its custom ML-style syntax.

\item The Sledgehammer tool \cite{paulson-blanchette-2010}, which bridges the
interactive theorem prover Isabelle\slash HOL and first-order automatic provers,
has been extended to output TFF1 problems without arithmetic. Once it is fitted
with a TFF1 parser, it will also be able to act as a translation tool from TFF1
to TFF0 and FOF.

%\item The Why3 \cite{bobot-et-al-2011} tool, which provides its own polymorphic
%specification language, supports TFF1 both for input and output. It can be used
%to translate between TFF1 and existing formats (FOF, SMT-LIB, etc.).
\end{itemize}

Other tools, notably an LF-based type checker similar to TwHelFTC for THF0,
are in development.
%
Using Sledgehammer and Why3, we generated nearly 1000 TFF1 problems to populate
the new PFF (``\relax{P}olymorphic T\relax{FF}'') domain of the TPTP library.
