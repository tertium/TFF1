\section{Applications}
\label{sec_apps}

A number of applications already support TFF1. First and foremost, Geoff
Sutcliffe has extended the TPTP World infrastructure to process TFF1 problems
and solutions. This involved in particular adapting the BNF specification of the
TPTP syntaxes, from which parsers are generated. Some tools still need to be
ported to TFF1; this is ongoing work.

%%% TODO: update: grep "pure"
The Why3 \cite{bobot-et-al-2011} environment, which defines its own polymorphic
specification language, can parse pure TFF1. Why3 translates
between TFF1 and a wide range of existing formats, including FOF, SMT-LIB, and
Alt-Ergo's native syntax. In addition, Why3's TFF1 parser is being ported to
Alt-Ergo \cite{bobot-et-al-2008}, so that it can process TFF1 problems without
taking a detour through Why3; code sharing is facilitated here by the use of
a common implementation language (OCaml).

Sledgehammer \cite{paulson-blanchette-2010}, a tool that bridges the interactive
theorem prover Isabelle\slash HOL and various automatic provers, has been
extended to output pure TFF1 problems for Alt-Ergo. Using Sledgehammer, we
generated 987 problems to populate the PFF (``\relax{P}olymorphic T\relax{FF}'')
domain of the TPTP library. By extending the tool with a TFF1 parser,
we hope to transform it into a highly versatile translation service to FOF and
TFF0.

%in development.
