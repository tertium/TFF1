\section{Applications}
\label{sec_apps}

Geoff Sutcliffe has extended the TPTP World infrastructure to process TFF1
problems and solutions. This involved in particular adapting the BNF
specification of the TPTP syntaxes, from which parsers are generated. Some tools
still need to be adapted to TFF1 (or TFF0); this is ongoing work.

A few other applications provide some support for TFF1:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The SMT solver Alt-Ergo can process problems expressed in TFF1 besides its
custom ML-style syntax.

\item The Sledgehammer tool, which bridges the interactive theorem prover
Isabelle\slash HOL and first-order automatic provers, has been extended to
output TFF1 problems without arithmetic. Once it is fitted with a TFF1 parser,
it will also be able to act as a translation tool from TFF1 to TFF0 and FOF.

\item The Why3 specification language and tool handles TFF1 both as input and
output.
\end{itemize}

Other tools, notably an LF-based type checker similar to TwHelFTC for THF0,
are in development.

Using Sledgehammer and Why3, we generated XXXX problems to populate the TFF1
part of the TPTP library.
