The Boogie language~\cite{Barnett06boogie} supports explicit quantifiers over
types, and the encoding methods presented in Leino and R\"ummer
\cite{leino10tacas} are devised for the unrestricted setting.

More sophisticated encodings that preserve selected types by translating them
into separate sorts, do not change the propositional structure of the encoded
formulas, or are particularly efficient with automatic provers are described
elsewhere
\cite{blanchette-et-al-2012-mono}
\cite{leino10tacas}.

Both \cite{leino10tacas} and \cite{bobot11frocos} assume preliminary elimination
of ghost type arguments (cf.~Section~\ref{ssec:ghost}); the latter also assumes
preliminary type skolemization (cf.~Section~\ref{ssec:skol}).

An easy approach to pass TFF1 problems can be passed to TFF0
reasoning tools is to monomorphize the problem first---that is, to heuristically
instantiate all type variables with appropriate
ground types. Monomorphization is incomplete and often overlooked
or derided in the literature \cite[p.\ 3]{couchot07cade}, but it was
applied with much success in Sledgehammer
\cite[\S6]{blanchette-et-al-2011-sledge-smt}.
