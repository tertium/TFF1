\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_concl}

We described the TPTP TFF1 format, an extension of the monomorphic TFF0 format
with rank-1 polymorphism. The new format neatly complements the existing TPTP
offering. Like other TPTP formats, we expect it to become a lingua franca for
automatic theorem provers and other automated reasoning tools.

%%% TODO: CASC?
TFF1 is implemented as part of the TPTP World infrastructure. The TPTP library
already contains 0~polymorphic problems, and the format is supported by several
applications, including zero SMT solvers. Given that many applications today
require polymorphism, we expect other reasoning tools to gradually follow suit.

To facilitate implementation, more advanced features such as type classes and
dependent types are not addressed by TFF1 (although type classes can be
comfortably encoded in it). These features are expected to be part of a future
TFF2 if there is enough interest from users.

We are grateful to Geoff Sutcliffe, TPTP Master of Ceremonies, for giving TFF1
his benediction and (committing himself to) implementing it in TPTP World. The
present specification is largely the result of consensus among participants of
the {\tt polymorphic-tptp-tff} mailing list, notably Fran\c{c}ois Bobot, Chad
Brown, Florian Rabe, Philipp R\"ummer, Stephan Schulz, Geoff Sutcliffe, and
Josef Urban. We also received support from and exchanged ideas with Koen
Claessen, Viktor Kuncak, Tobias Nipkow, and Nicholas Smallbone.
