We are grateful to Geoff Sutcliffe, TPTP Master of Ceremonies, for giving TFF1
his benediction and (committing himself to) implementing it in TPTP World. The
present specification is largely the result of consensus among participants of
the {\tt polymorphic-tptp-tff} mailing list, notably Fran\c{c}ois Bobot, Chad
Brown, Florian Rabe, Philipp R\"ummer, Stephan Schulz, Geoff Sutcliffe, and
Josef Urban. We also received support from and exchanged ideas with Koen
Claessen, Viktor Kuncak, Tobias Nipkow, and Nicholas Smallbone.
