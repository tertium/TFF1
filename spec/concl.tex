\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_concl}

We described the TPTP TFF1 format, an extension of the monomorphic TFF0 format
with rank-1 polymorphism. The new format nicely complements the existing TPTP
offering. %, taking over where TFF0 left off.
For reasoning tools that already
support polymorphism, TFF1 is a portable supplement to the existing ad hoc
syntaxes. But more importantly, the format is a vehicle to foster native
polymorphism support in automatic theorem provers. The time is ripe: After years
upon years of untyped reasoning, the last decade witnessed the rise of
interpreted arithmetic embedded in restrictive monomorphic type systems. TFF1
lifts some of the most obvious restrictions.

TFF1 is implemented as part of the TPTP World infrastructure. The TPTP library
already contains nearly a thousand TFF1 problems, and although the format is
still in its infancy, it is supported by several applications, including the SMT
solver Alt-Ergo (via Why3). Given that many applications today require
polymorphism, we expect other reasoning tools to gradually follow suit. The
annual CADE Automated System Competition (CASC) will also play an important
part here, starting with the 2013 edition.

Of course, rank-1 polymorphism is no panacea. More advanced features, such as
type classes and dependent types, are not addressed (although type
classes can be comfortably encoded in TFF1). These features are expected to be
part of a future TFF2 if there is enough interest from users and implementers.

The present specification is largely the result of consensus among
participants of the {\tt polymorphic-tptp-tff} mailing list, especially
Fran\c{c}ois Bobot, Chad Brown, Florian Rabe, Philipp R\"ummer, Stephan Schulz,
Geoff Sutcliffe, and Josef Urban.
We are grateful to Geoff Sutcliffe, TPTP Master of Ceremonies, for giving TFF1
his benediction and adapting the TPTP BNF and other infrastructure.
We also thank Viktor Kuncak, Tobias Nipkow, and Nicholas Smallbone for their
support and ideas.
