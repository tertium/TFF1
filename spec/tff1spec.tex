\begin{abstract}
The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) is a library of problems
for theorem provers. TPTP defines concrete syntaxes for various logics, notably
an untyped first-order form (FOF) and a monomorphic, simply typed first-order
form (TFF0), that have become de facto standards in the automated reasoning
community. This \paper{} describes the TPTP TFF1 format, an extension of TFF
with rank-1 polymorphism. The format was designed to be easy to process
by existing reasoning tools that support ML-style polymorphism. It opens the
door for useful middleware---for example, monomorphizers and other translation
tools that encode polymorphism in FOF or TFF0. Ultimately, our hope is that TFF1
will be implemented directly in popular automatic theorem provers.
