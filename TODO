- TPTP syntax proposal

    dummy type variables (aka $tType > ...)?

        DONE: dummy type vars are allowed, the syntax $tType > ... is not.

    free use of arrows?

        DONE: not allowed. Type signatures have one accepted form.

- spec

    $o handling?

        NOT DONE: what could we do about it anyway?

- Decide what to do with types-under-values quantifiers.
  We have no easy way to translate them for Isabelle/Why3/Alt-Ergo
  (short of translation to monomorphic logic).
  However, to banish them from TFF1 is kind of silly:
  - both native semantics and encoding to TFF0 handle them fine;
  - Boogie accepts them just as fine;
  - from the syntax POV, the restriction would be ugly.

- Decide on the use of TFF, TFF0, and TFF1. So far, I've never used
  TFF0 in the main text (only in footnotes), and employed TFF and
  TFF1 interchangeably. Do we plan to make the names TFFx official?
  Can we say that TFF is always the most recent TFFx?
